## SecWiz Usage

### Main Menu
Highlight the menu option you would like to select using __ArrowLeft__ and __ArrowRight__.
Use __Enter__ to select the highlighted option.

### Chat
- After selecting _CHAT_ in the main menu you will be prompted to ask a question.
- Any question you ask will be compared to answerable questions using fuzzy string matching.

- You can enter prompts such as _No more Questions_, _Goodbye_, _Back_, and _Exit_, to return to the __main menu__.

### Help
- The help option in the main menu provides you with some information about SecWiz and how to use it.

### Exit
- Exit does what it says - it closes the application.
